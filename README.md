# cert4android

cert4android is a library for Android to manage custom certificates which has
been developed for [DAVx‚Åµ](https://www.davx5.com). Feel free to use
it in your own open-source app.

# Features

* uses a service to manage custom certificates
* supports multiple threads and multiple processes (for instance, if you have an UI
  and a separate `:sync` process which should share the certificate information)


# How to use

1. Add the [jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io) repository to your project's level `build.gradle`:
    ```groovy
    allprojects {
        repositories {
            // ... more repos
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }
    }
    ```
   or if you are using `settings.gradle`:
    ```groovy
    dependencyResolutionManagement {
        repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
        repositories {
            // ... more repos
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }
    }
    ```
2. Add the dependency to your module's `build.gradle` file:
    ```groovy
    dependencies {
       implementation 'com.github.bitfireAT:cert4android:<version>'
    }
    ```
3. Create an instance of `CustomCertManager` (`Context` is required to connect to the
   `CustomCertService`, which manages the custom certificates).
4. Use this instance as `X509TrustManager` in your calls (for instance, when setting up your HTTP client).
   Don't forget to get and use the `hostnameVerifier()`, too.
5. Close the instance when it's not required anymore (will disconnect from the
   `CustomCertService`, thus allowing it to be destroyed).

Example of initialzing an okhttp client:

    val keyManager = ...
    CustomCertManager(...).use { trustManager ->
        val sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS")
        sslContext.init(
            if (keyManager != null) arrayOf(keyManager) else null,
            arrayOf(trustManager),
            null
        )
        val builder = OkHttpClient.Builder()
        builder.sslSocketFactory(sslContext.socketFactory, trustManager)
               .hostnameVerifier(hostnameVerifier)
        val httpClient = builder.build()
        // use httpClient
    }


You can overwrite resources when you want, just have a look at the `res/strings`
directory. Especially `certificate_notification_connection_security` and
`trust_certificate_unknown_certificate_found` should contain your app name.

# Changelog
## 2023-08-28
- `IOnCertificateDecision` has been deprecated, instead `CompletableDeferred` is used.
  - `ICustomCertService`:\
    Replace `checkTrusted(ByteArray, Boolean, Boolean, IOnCertificateDecision)` with `checkTrusted(X509Certificate, Boolean, Boolean): Boolean`,
    this means, removing the callback.
  
    The certificate can now be passed directly instead of using raw bytes.
  
    The new function is suspending, see KTDoc for more information.
  - `CustomCertService`:\
    Just as in `ICustomCertService`, remove callback, and use the returned `Boolean`.
- `CustomCertManager` now has an extra constructor parameter called `timeout` it's used for making sure custom
  certificate checks do not take longer than a desired amount.
